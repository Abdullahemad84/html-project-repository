    <h1>Operating system</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 1500px;"><strong> An operating system (OS) </strong>is system software that manages computer hardware,
        software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

        Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system
        and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time,
        mass storage, printing, and other resources.
        
        For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation,
        the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,
        [1][2] although the application code is usually 
        executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function
        or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer
        – from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.
        
        The dominant general-purpose[3] desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with
        a market share of around 76.45%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (17.72%),
        and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (1.73%).[4] In the mobile
        sector (including smartphones and tablets), Android's share is up to 72% in the year
        2020.[5] According to third quarter 2016 data, Android's share on smartphones is
        dominant with 87.5 percent with also a growth rate of 10.3 percent per year, 
        followed by Apple's iOS with 12.1 percent with per year decrease in market share
        of 5.2 percent, while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent.[6]
        Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other 
        specialized classes of operating systems (special-purpose operating systems)[3][7]),
        such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications. Security-focused 
        operating systems also exist. Some operating systems have low system requirements 
        (e.g. light-weight Linux distribution).
        Others may have higher system requirements.</p>

        <p style="max-width: 1500px;"><strong>Astra Linux</strong> is a Russian Linux-based computer operating system (OS) developed to meet the needs of the Russian army, other armed forces and intelligence agencies.[1] It provides data protection up to the level of "top secret" in Russian classified information grade. It has been officially certified by Russian Defense Ministry, Federal Service for Technical and Export Control[2] and Federal Security Service.</p>

        <p style="max-width: 1500px;"><strong>Deepin</strong>   (stylized as deepin; formerly known as Linux Deepin and Hiweed Linux[6][4]) is a Linux distribution based on Debian's stable branch. It features DDE, the Deepin Desktop Environment, built on Qt and available for various distributions like Arch Linux, Fedora, Manjaro and Ubuntu. As of version 15.10 it also uses dde-kwin, a set of patches for KDE Plasma's window manager.[7] In 2019, Huawei started to ship Linux laptops pre-installed with deepin.[8] Deepin's userbase is predominately Chinese, and it is developed in Wuhan, China by Wuhan Deepin Technology, as of 1 January 2020, a wholly owned subsidiary of UnionTech (统信软件).</p>

        <p style="max-width: 1500px;"><strong>Kanotix</strong> , also referred to as KANOTIX, is an operating system based on Debian, with advanced hardware detection.[1][2] It can run from an optical disc drive or other media i.e. USB-stick without using a hard disk drive.

            Kanotix uses KDE Software Compilation as the default desktop environment. Since 2013 the newer releases ship with LXDE as a second lightweight desktop environment. Unlike other similar Linux-distributions Kanotix is a rolling release. Nightly builds are automated builds every night of the latest development code of KANOTIX and with the latest packages from the repositories.[3] The name "Kanotix" is derived from the founder's nickname "Kano". Kanotix's mascot is a fangtooth.</p>

            The desktop environments are MATE and KDE, and the default display manager is LightDM.[3][4]
            
            The system is certified to run on devices which have a minimum of 256MB of RAM, and it is suitable for both 32-bit (i386) and 64-bit (amd64) processor architectures.[5] Moreover, the project is available for ARMv7 (armhf) architectures.</p>
